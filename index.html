                Fortunes turned when Byleth discovered a document, hidden away on Linhardt's desk, which provided a
                ground-breaking discovery. Cast unwittingly into prominence, Linhardt was put to work in earnest. In

                Though grateful for the end of the war, Byleth and Linhardt were disappointed to see that there was no
                time to relax. The fight against those who slither in the dark began immediately, and Linhardt abandoned
                his territory to help fight for a world of peace and quiet. Though the struggle was bitter, he took
                heart in the knowledge that once it was over, he and Byleth could spend the rest of their days in
                leisure, chasing idle pursuits far away from the stage of battle.

                as an intermediary between Faerghus and the church and—alongside the archbishop—committed to improve

                Byleth married Felix almost immediately after ascending the throne of the United Kingdom of Fódlan. When
                it came to matters of governance, Felix often took on duties that would have required his wife to dirty
                her hands and thus came to be called The Royal Sword. After they accomplished all they had set out to
                do, the couple left the rule of Fódlan to the next generation, disappearing into obscurity with blades
                in hand. Thereafter, history only provides unconfirmed reports of a pair of traveling mercenaries who
                possessed unmatched strength and skill.

                Byleth married Felix, who had become Duke Fraldarius, shortly after she was named to succeed Rhea as
                archbishop. Felix focused his efforts on restoring his territory and the Kingdom and became the
                archbishop's closest confidant, both privately and officially. They often spent a lot of time apart, but
                whenever they reunited, they had a tradition of crossing blades before crossing words. Attendants
                remarked that the smiles they wore on their faces during these bouts were never seen elsewhere.
                <br>
                Byleth and Felix were engaged to be married soon after the Battle of Fhirdiad. The war against those who
                slither in the dark was long and arduous, but they found solace always in one another. When the fighting
                was finally done, they held a modest wedding ceremony and entered a new life together as husband and
                wife. Where they went afterward is not known, but it is widely believed that they traveled the world as
                mercenaries, side by side, blades in hand.

                When at last the fight was done, they moved to a small village in the Faerghus region and started an

                more than capable in the role, applying her great insight and intelligence toward a better Fódlan. When
                the rebuilding effort was complete, the couple and their children enjoyed long and peaceful lives.

                Byleth announced his/her engagement to Lysithea shortly after being named archbishop of the Church of
                Seiros. Before they were officially wed, she returned home, helped her father to restore Ordelia
                territory, and offered the land up to be governed by neighboring lords. Once her parents had retired and
                withdrawn, Lysithea finally became the archbishop's wife. Even without her Crests, she proved more than
                capable of assisting him in his role, applying her great insight and intelligence toward a renewed
                church. Once the rebuilding effort was complete, the couple and their two children enjoyed long and

                Almost immediately after Byleth and Lysithea had celebrated their engagement, the struggle against those
                who slither in the dark began in earnest. Together they fought tirelessly to bring the war to an end so
                that Fódlan could have lasting peace. Afterward, they left the Imperial army for Ordelia territory,
                where they were officially wed. After restoring their war-torn land, the couple vanished from the public
                eye, along with Count Ordelia and his wife. No records remain of their lives after that, but it is
                rumored that they retired to a peaceful life in Derdriu, making sweets.

                Byleth announced his/her marriage to Flayn shortly after being named archbishop of the Church of Seiros.
                Flayn chose not to get involved in management of the church, instead focusing on healing those who had
                been hurt by the war. Her compassionate demeanor led many to speculate that she was "the second coming
                of Saint Cethleann." When Fódlan was finally restored, the archbishop named a successor, and the couple
                retired to a royal villa on the Rhodos Coast of western Fódlan. They spent their remaining years there
                in peace, fishing a great deal. It is said that no matter their age, they always retained a youthful
                appearance.

                After ascending the throne as the first queen of the United Kingdom of Fódlan, Byleth appointed Seteth
                as her prime minister. As they set about the grand task of restoring Fódlan, the prime minister's
                strictness combined with the queen's magnanimity won the people over easily. Their personalities
                complemented one another perfectly in dealings with obstinate lords. When their long work was done, they
                finally announced their marriage, to the shock and delight of their subjects. The people considered
                themselves truly blessed to be governed by such a union.

                Byleth took on the role of archbishop of the Church of Seiros, and Seteth continued in his position of
                adviser. As they set about the grand task of restoring Fódlan and the church, Seteth's strictness
                combined with the archbishop's magnanimity won the faithful over easily. Their personalities
                complemented one another perfectly in keeping church operations smooth. When Fódlan returned to
                stability, they finally announced their marriage, to the shock and delight of the people. The faithful
                considered themselves truly blessed to be guided by such a pair.

                Fódlan. With tireless work, great sacrifice, and her devoted servant Hubert by her side, she instituted
                new class reforms and helped to ensure the people's independence. Hubert was always close at hand, ready
                to dispose of unsavory burdens by any means necessary. In their later years, they passed the fruits of
                her labor on to Edelgard's successor and vanished from the public eye. Though it is said they spent the
                rest of their lives together, it is unlikely they ever gave voice to the true depth of their affections.

                As the Adrestian emperor, Edelgard appointed Ferdinand as her prime minister, and the two devoted
                themselves to ruling Fódlan. Their sharply contrasting views made for frequent and lively debate, but
                with each enhancing the perspective of the other, Fódlan was better for it. As they worked tirelessly to
                create a better future, they were soon bound together by marriage as well. Their children, born to those
                who had torn down the old social hierarchy, were encouraged to choose their own paths.

                As the new Adrestian emperor, Edelgard gave all she had to breathe new life into the government of
                Fódlan. With tireless work and great sacrifice, she instituted new class reforms to ensure that people
                could rise on their own merits. During those years, however, there was a period of time in which she
                simply disappeared. It is said that she went to the research facility of the foremost authority in
                Crests, Linhardt, who had relinquished his rank and title to live a life of study. There, after
                confirming the results of Linhardt's experiments, Edelgard was able to enjoy a rare break from her busy
                life. The respite was brief, but they cherished that time for the rest of their lives.

                Edelgard, the new Adrestian emperor, appointed Caspar as her Minister of Military Affairs, and the two
                devoted themselves to ruling Fódlan. Caspar quickly developed a reputation for recklessness in his duty,
                but he compensated for it with successes in the field and was given leeway by the emperor as a result.
                Privately, the couple's relationship as husband and wife was more tempestuous. Their spats were
                frequent, but it is said that Edelgard took pleasure in her ability to influence Caspar, and Caspar
                enjoyed reining the emperor in from time to time. It was a strange but happy union.

                When Bernadetta inherited House Varley from her father, she tried to withdraw from politics and remain
                within the bounds of her territory, but Edelgard, the new Adrestian emperor, would not allow it.
                Instead, she demanded that Bernadetta counsel her in governing Fódlan. It is said that the emperor made
                this choice to keep herself from being too detached, and that Bernadetta was all too happy to provide a
                more emotional perspective now and again. The people of Enbarr could always tell when the two were
                meeting by the sound of Bernadetta's panicked voice ringing out from the palace.

                As Edelgard's reign as the Adrestian emperor began, Enbarr was restored, and with it, a certain opera
                house. Soon the Mittelfrank Opera Company put together a war drama depicting the journey and sacrifice
                of the emperor and her companions, and the starring role went to none other than Dorothea. Edelgard
                initially forbade the company from staging it, but was eventually persuaded by Dorothea's passionate
                performance to rescind that decree. It is said that the emperor always set aside time to enjoy the opera
                thereafter.

                As the new Adrestian emperor, Edelgard gave all she had to breathe new life into the government of
                Fódlan. To that end, Hanneman's research proved invaluable. Seeking to determine the nature of Crests,
                and to do away with the inequality caused by them, the Father of Crestology produced magical tools that
                could be used even without the aid of Crests. These were put to eager use by Edelgard, who saw both of
                their dreams realized. It is not hard to imagine that a pair with such similar ideologies and plans for
                the future would eventually settle into an affectionate and fulfilling relationship.

                Fódlan. Her first objective was to institute new class reforms and ensure the people's independence. For
                that reason, she sought the counsel of Manuela, whose vast array of contacts, talents, and experience
                proved invaluable. She became essential to Edelgard, and her skill as a physician kept the emperor in
                good health for many years. Both remained unmarried, and it is said that the two became extremely close
                over the years.

                dark. The struggle was long and arduous, but not without its benefits. With careful analysis of ancient
                techniques, they discovered ways to recover the years of life that had been stolen from them.
                Afterwards, the new Adrestian emperor and Lysithea, her trusted officer, devoted the rest of their lives
                to Fódlan's rule. For her counsel in instituting class reforms and ensuring the independence of the
                people, Lysithea came to be known as the Wisdom of the Empire. The pair of talented women ushered Fódlan
                into a new age of innovation and prosperity.

                After his coronation, Dimitri assumed the throne of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, and his loyal vassal,
                Dedue, remained ever at his side. Among Dimitri's achievements was the reconciliation with Duscur: an
                extraordinary effort that required extensive negotiations to get past a history of betrayal and
                oppression. It was a trying task, but Dimitri never once considered giving up. While they behaved as
                lord and vassal in public, it is said that Dimitri and Dedue were more like family in private. When
                Dimitri finally fell to illness, Dedue tended to his liege's deathbed, and then took up a post at his
                grave for the rest of his days. When the time came, they were buried beside each other.
